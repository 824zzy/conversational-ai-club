# About CAIC

CAIC(Conversational AI Club) is a open study group for ChatBot builders.

## Motivation

I'll start my Ph.D program on this September to study how to build ChatBot with the latest machine learning algrithms.

I'm very excited. However, I totally have no idea about where to get started.

A month ago, my friend recommend me to read the [Neural Approaches to Conversational AI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/neural-approaches-to-conversational-ai/), which is a tutorial from ACL and SIGIR, published on July 5, 2018.

It's a 175 pages slide in very clear structure with all of the state-of-the-art papers which I believe they are all my need to study in the following 12 months.

It gives me a way to enter the Conversational AI world, so I decide to find some friends like me who really love chatbot and want to build one, to study Conversitional AI together.
